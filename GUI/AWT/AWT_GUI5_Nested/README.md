This code is an alternate way of doing AWT_GUI2.java, which incorporates nested class in it.
Two methods to get the source out of sources of same type has been used : getActionCommand() and getSource(), both of them methods of Class ActionEvent.
A window listener has been implemented too to close the window. 
Compiling the java file creates separate .class file for every nested and outer class.
