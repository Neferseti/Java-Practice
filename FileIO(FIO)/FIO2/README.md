This program utilised Scanner class streamed by the character stream generated through InputStreamReader. It is an efficient way than just using InputStreamReader. 
To write to a file, PrintWriter class has been used, instead of OutputStreamWriter, since it makes it much easy to write a string to a file than the other aforementioned method.
It is imperative to close the stream when they are of no more use, otherwise, as in case of PrintWriter, nothing will be printed to the file.
